**dconv** is a C++14 library for printing and parsing floating point numbers.

Double to string conversion is done using the **Grisu2** algorithm, described by **Florian Loitsch** in its publication [Printing Floating-Point Numbers Quickly and Accurately with Integers](https://florian.loitsch.com/publications).

String to double conversion is done using a fast and simple (but not accurate!) approach and fallback to **strtod** if conversion can't be done the simplified way.

The code is far from being perfect so any help to improve speed, accuratie, code quality etc... is welcome.

## Download

To download the latest source do this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrabine/dconv.git
```

## Configuration

To configure dconv do this:
```bash
cd dconv
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

## Installation

To install dconv do this:
```bash
make && sudo make install
```

Note that building and installing the library is not required as it is a header only library.

## Usage

The printing API can be used this way:

```cpp
#include <dconv/dtoa.hpp>

char value [25];
char* end = dconv::dtoa (value, -2.22507e-308);
```

The parsing API can be used this way:

```cpp
#include <dconv/atod.hpp>

double value;
char* end = dconv::atod ("-2.22507e-308", value);
```
